# Finch-Robot-Project

This was a group project made during my first year at university. We were presented with a Finch robot (birdbraintechnologies) and tasked to each develop functionality for the Finch, e.g. colour, moving, drawing shapes, making noise, etc. We then integrated our code so that one Finch could produce all the different functions. This project was an excellent introduction to Java for me.
